Hello again,  I have created a another game using Javascript.  This time I created <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=it0sf4CMDeM" title="Pong Gameplay">pong</a>.  

My reasoning for learning this time was to use good coding practices associated with Javascript using the <a href="http://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/#constructorpatternjavascript">constructor pattern</a>.  This also introduced me to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window.setInterval">setInterval</a> and other <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest/Synchronous_and_Asynchronous_Requests">asynchronous</a> topics within Javascript.  

Here you can go and take a <a href="http://www.andrewschutt.net/pong.html">look at the game</a> for yourself.
