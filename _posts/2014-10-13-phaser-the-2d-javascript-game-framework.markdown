Came across this powerful Javascript library that helps you create 2D games called Phaser.
<div>A short <a href="http://www.photonstorm.com/phaser/tutorial-making-your-first-phaser-game">guide</a>Â on the Phaser site will help get you started.</div>

Using the library I was able to create my own <a href="http://www.andrewschutt.net/flappybird.html">clone of flappy bird</a>.  My high score was 8.  I like to think my version is a little more challenging then the iPhone version!
